            Hey there! ðŸ‘‹ Iâ€™m someone who gets a real kick out of seeing my knowledge solve real-world problemsâ€”bonus points if I can actually see it working, whether in the digital realm or the physical world.
            Computing has been my gateway into this crazy journey, and I have a serious habit of experimenting with things. Maybe thatâ€™s why research and business are the two words that keep buzzing in my vocabulary.
            In this blog, I share bits of my experiences, from my very first steps in tech to my latest (mis)adventures. Hopefully, even the nonsense I write here helps someone with similar interests.
            Oh, and one last thingâ€¦ <span className="force-text">May the Force be with you! âœ¨</span>
          </p>
        </div>
      </div>
    </Card>
